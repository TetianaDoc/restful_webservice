This project was created on spring guide (https://start.spring.io) and walks through the process of creating a "`Hello, World`" RESTful web
service with Spring.

It was build the service that accepts HTTP GET requests at
`http://localhost:8080/greeting`.

It responds with a JSON representation of a greeting, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,json]
----
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}
----
====

It can be customized the greeting with an optional `name` parameter in the query string, as
the following listing shows:

====
[source,text]
----
http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User
----
====

The `name` parameter value overrides the default value of `World` and is reflected in the
response, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,json]
----
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, User!"}
----
